# Contributing

RingSquared uses GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request,
  addressing (with `@...`) the maintainer of this repository (see
  [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)) in the description of the pull request.

* If you plan to do something more involved, first discuss your ideas
  on our [discussion board]().
  This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal
  of inspiration.

# What to contribute

The best way to help without speaking a lot of Go would be to share your
configuration, alerts, dashboards, and recording rules. If you have something
that works and is not in the upstream repository, please pay it forward and
share what works.
